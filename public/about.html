<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I'm passionate about becoming a web developer and immersing myself in the ever-evolving world of coding. 
  Taking lessons from both back end and front end development, I enjoy diving deep into each aspect, one step at a time, 
  to truly understand the intricacies of building robust and user-friendly websites.</p>

<p>Aside from coding, I have a myriad of interests that keep me engaged and inspired. 
  I have an insatiable appetite for learning languages, both programming and spoken, which mirrors my love for exploring different cultures and perspectives.
  When I'm not buried in code, you'll often find me strumming my guitar, belting out tunes (even if music doesn't always reciprocate), or tinkering on the piano.</p>

<p>I'm an avid reader and a music aficionado, finding solace in the pages of books and the melodies of various genres. 
  My taste in entertainment is eclectic, ranging from intense gore and horror movies to heartwarming Korean dramas and captivating American series. 
  Anime holds a special place in my heart, where I find myself lost in the imaginative worlds and compelling storylines.</p>

<p>Beyond my screen time, I'm a fervent animal lover, with a particular soft spot for cats. I find joy in their independent yet affectionate nature, and their presence brings me immense comfort.</p>

<p>I thrive on keeping myself busy and constantly challenging myself, whether it's tackling a new coding concept, mastering a difficult guitar riff, or delving into a complex storyline. 
  Life is an adventure, and I'm determined to explore every facet of it with enthusiasm and curiosity.</p>

<p>Let's connect and embark on this journey together, discovering the endless possibilities that lie ahead!</p>
