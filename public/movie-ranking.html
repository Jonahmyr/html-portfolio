<h1>The Best Movies According to Jonah</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The little Mermaid</h3> 

<p>This is my favourite anime. I love the beautiful images. I love mermaids! They're pretty and unworldy.</p>

<h3>Tinkerbell and the neverbeast </h3>

<p>It was a sad but educational/moving movie. It gives you how you can't judge a book by it's cover seriously. 
    It will teach you how to love and appreciate the duty you have even if your life depends on it. 
    I love how people can be supportive/or might go the other way around. 
    I love how friendship is real and takes hundred few years but will eventually come back.</p>
<h3>The Grudge</h3>
<p>I love how grotesue it is. I love how they directed the film. I love the storyline eventhough it keeps me awake at night. I love how it really sticks with you (lol *the grudge noises*)</p>
